If we are conscious we would realise this is very true with our own bodies but not been implemented in the world. We are working on building our first Cell Network to create a sustainable economy powered by digital technology.Again this is based on concept of Giving and not on taking as the Capitalist will tell you. Look Around in Nature, you get air free, water free, soil free. Everthing you have on this planet for your survival was given free to you but why is it Humans just only care about taking more and more. Earth ecosystem works on Giving not on taking.
